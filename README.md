If you are a contributor, then please work on the branch that is created automatically for your issue.

1. Try to use VS Code for contributing to this project because it is compatible with VS Code only. Although you can use any other editor for using these types.
2. When you will open this folder, VS Code will prompt you to open the workspace. Please click that button.
3. On opening the workspace, VS Code will ask you to install recommended extensions. Please install. There are two recommended extensions as of now - Better Comments, ESLint.

## 📃 Format

- Filename should be "-" separated.
- The type name should be same as file name but it should be in PascalCase.
- Please put all the examples in a namespace so that the variables and types of other files don't interfare. Namespace name should start with "N".
- 1 file should have only one type (or if you want to add an enhanced type related to the same type in a file then you can add. In this case the type name can differ, but namespace name should be equal to typename starting with "N").
- Each type should have a documentation about how to use the type with an example.
- This workspace uses **Better Comments** extension which helps in highlighting the comments. Please take benefit of this extension and write comments accordingly. For sample, please see any existing file, or contact me.
- The main type should be highlighted because that is the thing that you are coming here for. It should be easy to locate that.
- Please provide proper examples of how to use the types and how not to use.
- Please add all the examples inside namespace.

If you think that there can be any enhancement in the way comments/documentation is written or if there can be any enhancement in the project structure please feel free to raise an issue or contact me.
